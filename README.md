Financial analysis library to help evaluate values for many technical analysis indicators.

For now only some indicators are implemented (more to come)

- It would be possible to read BARs from Ninja Trader and Trade Station exports (for now).
- It would be possible to convert between them
- It would be possible to convert to other timeframes
- It would be possible to export indicator values to CSV format to use for other possibilities (charting, neural network, etc)

Look at the TODO.txt to what's planned and not implemented yet.


Library is written in the D programming language and supports the DUB package format.

I am new to D language, so this helps me to learn it - advices are welcome :)
