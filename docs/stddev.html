<b>Introduction:</b><br>
Standard deviation is a statistical term that measures the amount of variability or dispersion around an average.
 Standard deviation is also a measure of volatility. Generally speaking, dispersion is the difference between the actual value
 and the average value. The larger this dispersion or variability is, the higher the standard deviation. The smaller this
 dispersion or variability is, the lower the standard deviation. Chartists can use the standard deviation to measure expected
 risk and determine the significance of certain price movements.

<b>Calculation:</b><br>
Calculate the average (mean) price for the number of periods or observations.
      Determine each period's deviation (close less average price).
      Square each period's deviation.
      Sum the squared deviations.
      Divide this sum by the number of observations.
      The standard deviation is then equal to the square root of that number.<br><br>
