<b>Introduction:</b><br>
Developed by Donald Lambert and featured in Commodities magazine in 1980, the Commodity Channel Index (<u>CCI</u>) is a versatile indicator
 that can be used to identify a new trend or warn of extreme conditions. Lambert originally developed <u>CCI</u> to identify cyclical turns in
 commodities, but the indicator can successfully applied to indices, ETFs, stocks and other securities.
 In general, <u>CCI</u> measures the current price level relative to an average price level over a given period of time.
 <u>CCI</u> is relatively high when prices are far above their average. <u>CCI</u> is relatively low when prices are far below their average.
 In this manner, <u>CCI</u> can be used to identify overbought and oversold levels.

<br><br>
<b>Calculation:</b><br>
The example below is based on a 20-period Commodity Channel Index (<u>CCI</u>) calculation. The number of <u>CCI</u> periods is also used for the
 calculations of the simple moving average and Mean Deviation.
<br><br>

<br><br>

 <u>CCI</u> = (Typical Price  -  20-period SMA of TP) / (.015 x Mean Deviation)
 Typical Price (TP) = (High + Low + Close)/3
 Constant = .015
<br><br>

 There are four steps to calculating the Mean Deviation. First, subtract
 the most recent 20-period average of the typical price from each period's
 typical price. Second, take the absolute values of these numbers. Third,
 sum the absolute values. Fourth, divide by the total number of periods (20).<br><br>
