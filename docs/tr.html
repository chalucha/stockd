 Wilder started with a concept called True Range (<u>TR</u>), which is defined as the greatest of the following:
 Method 1: Current High less the current Low
 Method 2: Current High less the previous Close (absolute value)
 Method 3: Current Low less the previous Close (absolute value)
<br><br>

 Absolute values are used to ensure positive numbers.
 After all, Wilder was interested in measuring the distance between two points, not the direction.
 If the current period's high is above the prior period's high and the low is below the prior period's low,
 then the current period's high-low range will be used as the True Range.
 This is an outside day that would use Method 1 to calculate the <u>TR</u>. This is pretty straight forward.
 Methods 2 and 3 are used when there is a gap or an inside day. A gap occurs when the previous close is greater
 than the current high (signaling a potential gap down or limit move) or the previous close is lower than
 the current low (signaling a potential gap up or limit move).<br><br>
