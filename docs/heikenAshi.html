 Heikin-Ashi Candlesticks are an offshoot from Japanese candlesticks. Heikin-Ashi Candlesticks use the open-close data from the prior period
 and the open-high-low-close data from the current period to create a combo candlestick. The resulting candlestick filters out some noise in
 an effort to better capture the trend. In Japanese, Heikin means "average" and "ashi" means "pace" (EUDict.com). Taken together,
 Heikin-Ashi represents the average-pace of prices. Heikin-Ashi Candlesticks are not used like normal candlesticks. Dozens of bullish or bearish
 reversal patterns consisting of 1-3 candlesticks are not to be found. Instead, these candlesticks can be used to identify trending periods,
 potential reversal points and classic technical analysis patterns.

 HaClose = (Open+High+Low+Close)/4
      = the average price of the current bar
 HaOpen = [HaOpen(previous bar) + Close(previous bar)]/2
      = the midpoint of the previous bar
 HaHigh = Max(High, HaOpen, HaClose)
      = the highest value in the range
 HaLow = Min(Low, HaOpen, HaClose)
      = the lowest value in the range<br><br>
