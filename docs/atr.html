 Developed by J. Welles Wilder, the Average True Range (<u>ATR</u>) is an indicator that measures volatility.
 As with most of his indicators, Wilder designed <u>ATR</u> with commodities and daily prices in mind.
 Commodities are frequently more volatile than stocks. They were are often subject to gaps and limit moves,
 which occur when a commodity opens up or down its maximum allowed move for the session. A volatility formula
 based only on the high-low range would fail to capture volatility from gap or limit moves.
 Wilder created Average True Range to capture this "missing" volatility. It is important to remember that <u>ATR</u>
 does not provide an indication of price direction, just volatility.<br><br>
