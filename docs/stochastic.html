 Developed by George C. Lane in the late 1950s, the <u>Stochastic</u> Oscillator is a momentum indicator that shows the location of the close
 relative to the high-low range over a set number of periods. According to an interview with Lane, the <u>Stochastic</u> Oscillator
 "doesn't follow price, it doesn't follow volume or anything like that. It follows the speed or the momentum of price.
 As a rule, the momentum changes direction before price." As such, bullish and bearish divergences in the <u>Stochastic</u> Oscillator can be
 used to foreshadow reversals. This was the first, and most important, signal that Lane identified.
 Lane also used this oscillator to identify bull and bear set-ups to anticipate a future reversal.
 Because the <u>Stochastic</u> Oscillator is range bound, is also useful for identifying overbought and oversold levels.

<b>Calculation:</b><br>
%K = (Current Close - Lowest Low)/(Highest High - Lowest Low) * 100
      %D = 3-day SMA of %K

<br><br>
<b>Where:</b><br>
Lowest Low = lowest low for the look-back period
      Highest High = highest high for the look-back period
      %K is multiplied by 100 to move the decimal point two places

 Full <u>Stochastic</u> Oscillator:
      Full %K = Fast %K smoothed with X-period SMA
      Full %D = X-period SMA of Full %K<br><br>
