TODOs:
========

- make selection indicator to output just selected values from the output of chained indicator (for example just MACD line from MACD indicator, or just Close price from whole Bar)
- create evaluator factory to setup indicator chain to evaluate values
    - for example make something like SMA(HeikenAshi, 10) possible (evaluate SMA from HeikenAshi average bars, which are made from standard bars)
    - need to assert indicator input and output types so the chain gives sense
    - evaluate with indicator tree
- add buffer indicator to return also older values from the chained indicators - as an input to the neural network
- add normalize indicator to normalize chained indicator outputs
    - only outputs with the same meaning should be normalized
- output values from evaluator to the file -> to work with evaluated indicator values externally (as an input for a neural network for example)
- add preview param to add methods so we can see what the next value will be if its from closed bar - usable for live calculations from tick values as internal state of indicator is not changed
- make benchmarks for indicators and optimisations
- make unit-threaded tests
